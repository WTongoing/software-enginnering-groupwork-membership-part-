This project is a restaurant self-order system, allowing users to join the membership, login to self-order, add to the shopping cart and print receipts. 

This is a Team-Based project and my work includes:
* Implement functions including login, membership registration and personal profile display on the client side
* Use Java Swing to provide interactive interface for users(instead of interactive in the console), and apply XML(Extensible Markup Language) to the storage of member information details

Thanks to my friend aji guidance, saving me from my garbage code
